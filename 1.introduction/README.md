MVP
---
This part is about defining the minimum requirement for the app the participants
are to develop. A good pointer for developing is:
* What are the pages my app is going to have: specification of views.
* what objects do my app have, and how do they relate: Modeling.

Exercise 1
----------
The first exercise session is to get everything up running on your computer.
This requires a working installation of git:

* Windows: install this client: 
* Mac: Open the terminal, type git
* linux:
  * ubuntu: sudo apt-get install git
  * fedora sudo yum install git

After that you have to "clone" this gitrepository to your own computer. You do
that as follows:

Windows:

Other (terminal):
	git clone https://github.com/madsbuch/webAppPresentation.git

You now have a local copy of all the workshop files.
