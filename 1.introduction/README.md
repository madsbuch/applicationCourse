Objective
---------
Following are the objectives of the first workshop:
* The participants should know the functional/interaction requirement of their
  app.
* The participants computers should be set up so have access to exercise
  material (this repository).
* Participants should have developed a gameplan.

Terminology
-----------
Following is the terminology for this session:
* HTML
  * Tag, attribute
* CSS
  * Property
* JavaScript
  * Function, Variable
  * object, array, string, int
* Markdown
* Git
  * Committing, pulling, pushing, forking
* application stack
* database
  * Object, Collection
* client
* server
* framework
  * Frontend framework, Backend framework, Fullstack framework
* deployment
* MVP

Schedule
--------
1. Introduction to the course series
2. Presentation of the participants ideas
3. MVP
4. Exercise 1
5. Gameplan
6. Session evaluation

MVP
---
This part is about defining the minimum requirement for the app the participants
are to develop. A good pointer for developing is:
* What are the pages my app is going to have: specification of views.
* what objects do my app have, and how do they relate: Modeling.

Exercise 1
----------
The first exercise session is to get everything up running on your computer.
This requires a working installation of git:

* Windows: install this client: 
* Mac: Open the terminal, type git
* linux:
  * ubuntu: sudo apt-get install git
  * fedora sudo yum install git

After that you have to "clone" this gitrepository to your own computer. You do
that as follows:

### Windows:

1. Download program from: [windows.github.com](https://windows.github.com/)
2. Install the program.

### Other (terminal):
	git clone https://github.com/madsbuch/webAppPresentation.git

You now have a local copy of all the workshop files.

Exercise 2
----------
Taking offset in exercise 1, is is now your job to develop a web page which:
* Describes the terms in your own words.
* Has basic styling.
* Makes an alert with a message.

Remember that:
* h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 defines headings. They can be used to build structure
* paragraphs should be within a p tag


Developing the gameplan
-----------------------

###Goal of the week
* Being able to talk in the jargon
* Having a working structure of the app (this is not the final) including
  * Interface flow, which will be refined at the 3rd session
  * Functional requirements for the app
  * Business objects (the data the app stores)

###Steps to the gaol
1. having a local working copy of the course material
2. Solving exercise 1 from e1.html (obtaining knowledge on jargon)
3. Write down screens, and a flow between them
4. Explicitly state functionality of app
5. read the objectives list, and write 2 lines expressing what they are

###Stone on the stairs
* Problems with obtaining local copy of material and programming.
* When is the functionality of the app explicit enough?
* Level of details when discussing user interface.

###Resources
Resources are defined in the resource.md file
