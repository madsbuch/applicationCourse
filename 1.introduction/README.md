Objective
---------
Following is the objectives of the first workshop:
* The participants should know the functional/interaction requirement of their
  app.
* The participants' computers should be set up, so they have access to exercise
  material (this repository).
* Participants should have developed a gameplan.

Terminology
-----------
Following is the terminology for this session:
* HTML
  * Tag, attribute
* CSS
  * Property
* JavaScript
  * Function, Variable
  * Object, array, string, int
* Markdown
* Git
  * Committing, pulling, pushing, forking
* Application stack
* Database
  * Object, Collection
* Client
* Server
* Framework
  * Frontend framework, Backend framework, Fullstack framework
* Deployment
* MVP

Schedule
--------
1. Introduction to the course series
2. Presentation of the participants ideas
3. MVP
4. Exercise 1
5. Gameplan
6. Session evaluation

MVP
---
This part is about defining the minimum requirement for the app the participants
are to develop. A good pointer for developing is:
* What are the pages my app is going to have: specification of views.
* what objects do my app have, and how do they relate: Modeling.

Exercise 1
----------
The first exercise session is to get everything up running on your computer.
This requires a working installation of git:

* Windows: Follow the guide beneath.
* Mac: Open the terminal, type git
* Linux:
  * Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install git
  * Fedora: sudo yum install git

After that, you will have to "clone" this git repository to your own computer. You do
that as follows:

### Windows:

1. Download and install source tree app from: 
   [www.sourcetreeapp.com](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
2. If it asks from where to get git, pick the embedded solution.
3. click the "I agree button" and afterwards "Skip Setup".
4. Click "Clone / New", paste 
   "https://github.com/madsbuch/webAppPresentation.git" into the "Source Path /
   URL" field.
5. Press clone.
6. It is furthermore advantageous to install [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

### Other (terminal):
	git clone https://github.com/madsbuch/webAppPresentation.git

You now have a local copy of all the workshop files.

Exercise 2
----------
Taking offset in exercise 1, is is now your job to develop a web page which:
* Describes the terms in your own words.
* Has basic styling.
* Makes an alert with a message.

Remember that:
* h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 defines headings. They can be used to build structure
* paragraphs should be within a p tag


Developing the Gameplan
-----------------------

### Goal of the week
* Being able to talk in the jargon
* Having a working structure of the app (this is not the final) including
  * Interface flow, which will be refined at the 3rd session
  * Functional requirements for the app
  * Business objects (the data the app stores)

### Steps to the goal
1. Having a local working copy of the course material
2. Solving exercise 1 from e1.html (obtaining knowledge on jargon)
3. Write down screens, and a flow between them
4. Explicitly state functionality of app
5. Read the objectives list, and write 2 lines expressing what they are

### Problems that might occur 
* Problems with obtaining local copy of material and programming.
* When is the functionality of the app explicit enough?
* Level of details when discussing user interface.

###Resources
Resources are defined in the resource.md file
