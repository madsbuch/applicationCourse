Web App Course
==============
This is the material for a course in building modern application using
web-technologies

Motivation
----------
Many people are sitting around having great ideas but are unable to realize them.
These people use hours on trying to get a technical person on board their idea,
often without any luck.
Many of these apps are relatively easy to build with a minimal knowledge of
modern technologies and methods for building apps. 

Prerequisites
-------------
The participants of the course are not to have any technical knowledge, the
requirement is that they have an idea, or are able to quickly develop one, that
they want to implement as an app.

Layout

setting up static pages

###Business logic
Making sure all the bits and pieces are correctly connected and ensuring that

Execution
---------

The facilitator will for second course session pair each project with the needed
