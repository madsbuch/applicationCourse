Web App Course
==============
This is the course-material for facilitating building modern applications using
web-technologies

Motivation
----------
Many people are sitting around having great ideas but are unable to realize them.
Some use hours trying to get a technical person on board.
Many of these apps are relatively easy to build with a minimal knowledge of
modern technologies and methods for building apps. 

Prerequisites
-------------
The participants of the course are not to have any technical knowledge, the
requirement is that they have an idea, or are able to quickly develop one, that
they want to implement as an app.

Layout
------
The course consists of following 5 parts:

###Introduction
This is a short introduction to the technologies the course will cover:

Overall Learning Goals:
* Have a basic structure of application
* Be able to write basic HTML and CSS
* Knowledge of application structure and git
* modify JavaScript
* use markdown

###Git and Frameworks
Administrating your code, share it amongst the working parts and an introduction
to the framework you are going to build your app upon.

Overall Learning Goals:
* Be able to git for code sharing.
* Tell apart different types of framework

###User interaction part
Designing the client part. Defining views, deciding on menu structure and
setting up static pages

Overall Learning Goals
* Modify existing template code
* Making the template code work with the underlaying framework 

###Business logic
Making sure all the bits and pieces are correctly connected and ensuring that
the app does what supposed too. An introduction to test automation.

Overall Learning Goals
* Implement functionality through JavaScript

###Deployment
Putting the now working app online. After the struggles with making it work with
the hosting provider, we will hopefully pop a bottle.

Overall Learning Goals
* Basic testing
* Pushing the code to a PaaS

Execution
---------
The course takes offset in individual projects. This means that the first time
has the very important object of letting the facilitator know what the
individual projects consists of.

The facilitator will for second course session pair each project with the needed
framework to ensure ease in development.

### Session evaluation
All sessions have an evaluation part. This is to ensure proper feedback to the
facilitator.

The evaluation is in to parts:
* immediate thoughts on the facilitator
* reflections on the outcome of the session

### Gameplan
All sessions, but the last one, have a section for refining a gameplan. Sessions
should be initiated by handing out a gameplan, that set up a frame for acquiring
the curriculum of the week.

The overall vision of the gameplan is not stated every time. it is generally as
follows:

	Create a working minimal implementation of a given project.

###Assessment
All sessions has an assessment section, This should be filled out and handed in
to the facilitator. A time should be set, so the facilitator has enough time to
adjust the next session accordingly.
